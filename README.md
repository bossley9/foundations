## 1. Introduction

Software foundations are the underlying scientific and mathematical principles that dictate computer software. In addition to understanding a programming language syntax, a great software engineer should have a vast knowledge of data structures, the principles of mathematics, and common data algorithms. The purpose of this repository is to summarize all of these concepts and principles in one place. It's been a while since I have learned these concepts in school and I want to practice and preserve my knowledge in this area.

I will be using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to represent any data structures or algorithms in code due to its simple but typed syntax. I also work with this language on a daily basis so it will be easy for me to represent these concepts in a cleanly fashion.
